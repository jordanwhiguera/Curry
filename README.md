# Curry
# This is my first project using xcode. It features a sign up, sign up, and forgot password page. 
# Here, Firebase is used as the databe to authenticate users. When Users sign in, they will see a bunch 
# of different types of curries, and they can select one to learn more about it. 
# The user can then give a rating to that curry.
